### Intro to Ruby

### First language is ruby

### Sinatra

get '/' do 
  "hello world"
end


### Roda

Microframework like Sinatra, with powerful routing, auth (rodauth) and API

### Meta

start a Opal Inesita web app project 

how to start:

create a project dir, like esk8-calc

Go to the website, if it was sinatra I would have gone to sinatrarb.com or searchead on google "sinatra ruby"

http://www.sinatrarb.com/

this is the website, it contains the hello world:

#### ---

// sinatra.rb

```rb
require 'sinatra'

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
```

#### ---

// app log

$ gem install sinatra
$ ruby hi.rb

Web components, there are some,
